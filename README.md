# Longfor-Smart-Building-Project

Longfor(http://www.longfor.com/)
is the top 5 Real Estate company in China, and the first adopt Azure IoT Hub,
Stream Analytics in their Smart Building Solution on August 2016. Due to this technical
engagement, Longfor signed 100k$ Azure deal for deployment their smart building
solution. 

As L300 request, I mention 2 parts contribution on this project as following:
## 1. Solution Architect

Before 2016, Longfor built V1.0 smart building system, and deploy 20k sensor to collectiing building operation data, including power data, elevator operation data etc.

There are some suffer issue on this version, such as :
- Take more cost and time on transfer data between region site to monitor certer
- Too complex to deploy new feature on this region architect
- No realtime whole buildings monitor view
- No realtime alert functionality

After discussion with Longfor team, and leverage Azure IoT Services, we redefine Longfor Smart Buliding Solution Architect.

## 2. FEC Linux EasyARM-iMX257 IoT Hub SDK Integration

In this project, Longfor team use FEC Linux EasyARM-iMX257 as their IoT Gateway device, its OS is not the standard Linux OS, but a customized OS. we need to support them to re-compile our IoT Hub SDK for their client, then Longfor team use the re-compile SDK to finish integrated compile on the device.

Our re-compile IoT Hub SDK in [IoT Hub Example on Embedded Linux] (https://github.com/LitLi/Longfor-Smart-building-Project/tree/master/IoT%20Hub%20Example%20on%20Embedded%20Linux), the folder structure as follow:
  - ROOT
    - azure-umqtt-c
    - Linux2
    - openssl

Due to no SSL libarary on Longfor device OS, we also compile the openssl lib in to package. Fanilly, they use this package finished the integrated compile and connect with IoTHub to send message well. 

##Conclusion
Throught this technical engagement, Longfor finally make 100$ Azure Deal with Microsoft. In first stage ( before June 2017), Longfor will migrate 20K devices to IoTHub, and Second stage(Before June 2019ï¼‰, Longfor will deploy 100K devices to integrate with IoTHub.
