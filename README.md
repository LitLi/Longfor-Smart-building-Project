To date, this ISV has no solution that can monitor
vending machine health status or get real-time information on whether a device
is working. Any device needing attention usually requires two onsite
visits—once to diagnose the issue and again to return with the component to fix
the issue. All this adds to the cost of maintaining the machines. And also,
their goods manager must check on the selling status of the vending machines to
see if they need replenishing.

Use Azure IoT Hub to collect data on supplies and
device health for all vending machines and send to the uniform management
platform for daily monitoring. This will help the staff to diagnose device
issues online, which can save on maintenance costs and help realize predictive
maintenance cost savings.
