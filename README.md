Longfor(http://www.longfor.com/)
is the top 5 Real Estate company in China, and the first adopt Azure IoT Hub,
Stream Analytics in their Smart Building Solution on August 2016. Due to technical
engagement, Longfor sign 100k$ Azure deal for deployment their smart building
solution. 

As L300 request, I mention 3 parts contribution on this project as following:
## 1. Solution Architect

To date, this ISV has no solution that can monitor
vending machine health status or get real-time information on whether a device
is working. Any device needing attention usually requires two onsite
visitsâ€”once to diagnose the issue and again to return with the component to fix
the issue. All this adds to the cost of maintaining the machines. And also,
their goods manager must check on the selling status of the vending machines to
see if they need replenishing. 

## 2. FEC Linux EasyARM-iMX257 IoT Hub SDK Integration

Use Azure IoT Hub to collect data on supplies and
device health for all vending machines and send to the uniform management
platform for daily monitoring. This will help the staff to diagnose device
issues online, which can save on maintenance costs and help realize predictive
maintenance cost savings.

## 3. Stream Analytics Script

In this project, help ISV to setup and configure IoT
Hub, SA, and Azure SQL Database. More detail content and script files in [Data
Pipeline](https://github.com/LitLi/SmartVendingMachine-Project/tree/master/Data%20Pineline)
